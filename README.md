# GEDet

This document is for the project "GEDet: Adversarially Learned Few-shot Detection of Erroneous Nodes in Graphs", which is published on IEEE BigData 2020 as a regular paper.

To run the classification modular, simply run train.py
train.py needs the following input:
(1) A pre-trained graph embedding result from graph auto-encoder that stands for the (X^_L, A^_L) in the paper. To balance the class labels in the training examples, X'_l may contain embeddings for instances that are generated by node augmentation (optional)
(2) A pre-trained graph embedding result from graph auto-encoder that stands for the (X'_S, A^_L) in the paper. X'_S is the embeddings results after node augmentation
In the above two load functions, an augmented graph adjacency matrix is saved and directly loaded.

GEDet consists of several components and this repository will be updated and maintained by Sheng Guan. 
Please feel free to send emails to sxg967@case.edu if you have any questions.
Any contribution is highly appreciated!
