# GEDet

This document is for the project "GEDet: Adversarially Learned Few-shot Detection of Erroneous Nodes in Graphs", which is published on IEEE BigData 2020 as a regular paper.

To run the classification modular, simply run train.py
train.py needs the following input:
(1) A pre-trained graph embedding result from graph auto-encoder that stands for the (X'_L, A_L) in the paper. To balance the class labels in the training examples, X'_L may contain embeddings for instances that are generated by node augmentation (optional)
(2) A pre-trained graph embedding result from graph auto-encoder that stands for the (X'_S, A_L) in the paper. X'_S is the embeddings results after node augmentation
In the above two load functions, an augmented graph adjacency matrix A_L is saved and directly loaded.
The pre-trained results are saved in GEDet/processed/

GEDet now has a web interface availabel. The web interface isï¼š
